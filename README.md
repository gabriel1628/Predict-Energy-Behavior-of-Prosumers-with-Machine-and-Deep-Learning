# Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers with Machine and Deep Learning

This repo aims at tackling the challenge launched by Enefit in the Kaggle competition [Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers/overview).
The goal of the competition is to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels.
The data set contain consumption, production and weather data, the relevant energy prices, and records of the installed photovoltaic capacity.
